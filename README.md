**My portfolio**: [work.culi.page](https://work.culi.page/)

**Latest project**: [votevote](https://votevote.page/) (2022-02feb)

**About me**: I'm a full-stack engineer with a background in mathematics and an interest in community. I do a bit of everything (design, frontend, backend, data, testing, etc), but I have the most fun working on novel implementations for interesting algorithms, playing with data, and building beautiful and accessible front-ends (esp. data visualization).

**Languages I'm comfortable with**: Javascript/TypeScript (React, NodeJS), Python (data, ai, scraping, etc), Ruby (Rails)

**Skills**: Strong grasp of CSS, semantic HTML, and a11y practices. Data viz skills with `D3` and `matplotlib` and a good grasp of best practices. 

**Topics I wanna dive in deeper into**: generative algorithms, shaders, evolutionary algorithms, database infrastructures for crowd-source data, machine learning in general.
